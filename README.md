# DAP-Internship-Project

<h2> Problem Statement:</h2>
Choosing the right movie from the vast selection on streaming platforms can be overwhelming for users. This project aims to create a recommendation system that helps by suggesting movies tailored to individual preferences, viewing history, and ratings. By offering personalized recommendations, the system makes it easier for users to discover movies that match their tastes, enhancing their overall experience.

<h2> Project Description:</h2>
This movie recommendation system is developed using Python, leveraging various libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. The system focuses on analyzing movie data, user ratings, and viewing patterns using key libraries like Pandas for handling and manipulating data, NumPy for performing numerical operations, and Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualizing trends in user preferences and movie popularity. By identifying common patterns in user behavior, such as favored genres or frequently rated movies, the system provides customized movie recommendations tailored to individual users, improving their overall movie discovery process.
