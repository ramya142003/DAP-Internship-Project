<h1> Movie Recommendation Analysis </h1>

<h2> Problem Statement:</h2>
<p>Choosing the right movie from the vast selection on streaming platforms can be overwhelming for users. This project aims to create a recommendation system that helps by suggesting movies tailored to individual preferences, viewing history, and ratings. By offering personalized recommendations, the system makes it easier for users to discover movies that match their tastes, enhancing their overall experience.</p>

<h2> Project Description:</h2>
This movie recommendation system is developed using Python, leveraging various libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. The system focuses on analyzing movie data, user ratings, and viewing patterns using key libraries like Pandas for handling and manipulating data, NumPy for performing numerical operations, and Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualizing trends in user preferences and movie popularity. By identifying common patterns in user behavior, such as favored genres or frequently rated movies, the system provides customized movie recommendations tailored to individual users, improving their overall movie discovery process.

<h2>Analysis Questions: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What is the distribution of movie ratings?</li>
        <li>How does the budget vary across the top 20 different genres?</li>
        <li>What is the distribution of movie budgets?</li>
        <li>What is the trend of movie releases over the years?</li>
        <li>How does the revenue vary across the top 20 different genres?</li>
        <li>Which genres tend to have the highest budget and revenue?</li>
        <li>What are the top 15 highest-grossing movies?</li>
        <li>What is the distribution of movie durations?</li>
        <li>How has the movie production trend evolved over the years for the top 5 genres?</li>
        <li>What is the distribution of movie budgets for the top 5 genres?</li>
        <li>What does the correlation heatmap of the movie dataset reveal about the relationships between different numerical attributes?</li>
        <li>How do various movie trends in budget, revenue, popularity, runtime, and user ratings change over time?</li>
        <li>How does movie rating vary by director's experience (number of movies directed)?</li>
        <li>Are there any trends in movie release months?</li>
        <li>What is the relationship between budget and revenue for the top 10 genres?</li>
        <li>What is the distribution of movie durations for each genre?</li>
        <li>How does popularity vary with movie revenue?</li>
    </ol>
