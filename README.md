# DAP-Internship-Project

Project Description:
This movie recommendation system is developed using Python, leveraging various libraries while deliberately avoiding Scikit-learn. The system focuses on analyzing movie data, user ratings, and viewing patterns using key libraries like Pandas for handling and manipulating data, NumPy for performing numerical operations, and Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualizing trends in user preferences and movie popularity. By identifying common patterns in user behavior, such as favored genres or frequently rated movies, the system provides customized movie recommendations tailored to individual users, improving their overall movie discovery process.
